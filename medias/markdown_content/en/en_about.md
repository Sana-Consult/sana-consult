I set up SanaConsult with a clear intention: to help you deliver an exceptional experience for your teams and patients, while maximising the performance of your practice. My varied background, particularly in the airline industry and customer services, has enabled me to develop a unique expertise in management and service excellence. These skills, now applied to the medical field, are a powerful lever for improving not only the quality of your welcome and service, but also the economic efficiency of your practice. In 2009 I discovered the fascination world of ophthalmology. Thanks to my hands-on experience in dozens of ophthalmology centres across France, I've gained an in-depth understanding of the needs of patients and teams alike. My approach is based on listening, anticipating expectations and offering premium services that go beyond mere satisfaction to deliver real added value to your practice.

I am a regular speaker at the ESCRS Annual Conference as part of the LBI (Leadership and Business Innovation) programme, where I bring my expertise to bear on ophthalmologists and their teams. Today, I'm putting this wealth of experience to work for medical practices, with the aim of making life easier for doctors, enhancing relationships with their teams and boosting patient confidence. Each practice is unique and deserves personalised support, focused on optimising processes, improving the quality of care and, ultimately, developing your business. I know that the success of a practice depends on the skills and dedication of its teams. That's why I'm committed to working with you to strengthen these essential pillars, aiming for excellence that translates into concrete results. Every day, I strive to offer you the very best of my expertise with SanaConsult. Your satisfaction is my greatest reward, and your loyalty a sign of shared success. Thank you for being part of this adventure. Together, we write a new page every day, rich in emotion, discovery and success.
